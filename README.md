# 📊 Visual Explorations with Dominick’s Finer Foods Dataset

This project is a deep dive into large-scale retail analytics using the [Dominick’s Finer Foods dataset](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/research/kilts/research-data/dominicks), a rich public database consisting of supermarket scanner data from 1989–1997. The goal is to visualize complex consumer behavior, pricing trends, and store-level insights using R and `ggplot2`.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Explore and visualize patterns in big retail data
- Create multi-level graphics:
  - **Elementary** – zoomed-in, specific insights
  - **Intermediate** – grouped comparisons
  - **Overall** – holistic trends and long-term behavior
- Apply visual semiotics (Bertin's schemata) to drive clarity and storytelling
- Combine spatial, temporal, and categorical variables
- Practice and demonstrate good design principles in R graphics

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **Language**: R
- **Libraries**: 
  - `ggplot2` (main plotting)
  - `dplyr`, `tidyr` (data manipulation)
  - `readr` (data import)
  - `lubridate` (time series handling)

---

## 📈 Visualizations

The project includes at least six key graphics:
- Dot plots, rainfall plots, violin & box plots
- Calendar heatmaps and streamgraphs
- Multi-component comparisons using color, position, shape, and size

Each visualization is designed with:
- Clear visual grammar
- Defined question(s) it aims to answer
- Interpretation notes and insights
